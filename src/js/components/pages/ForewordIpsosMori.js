                            <p>When Shelter first shared with us their ambitions to create the Living Home Standard we quickly understood that this would be a unique and challenging project, but one that we were excited to have the opportunity to be involved in.</p>
                            <p>Defining a home that provides more than the bare minimum, that allows people to flourish, meant bringing in expertise from right across Ipsos MORI. It involved a sophisticated programme of research combining focus groups, workshops, digital communities and complex quantitative methods. We carefully studied the existing standards, literature and evidence, and consulted with experts in the field.  However, first and foremost creating the Living Home Standard was about the public.  Our biggest challenge was engaging with hundreds of members of the public on a wide range of topics from storage to stability and from pets to pests.  We then brought this diverse set of experiences and opinions together to converge on a standard which is has been led by public discussion and debate.</p>
                            <p>It has been a fascinating process, one we could not have achieved without the close collaboration of Shelter, but most importantly the hundreds of members of the public who gave up their time to talk about what home meant to them in discussion groups and online forums, and the thousands who participated in the survey research which helped us define and measure the Standard.  Without them, this would not have been possible, it is truly their Living Home Standard.</p>

                            <h4>Creating the Living Home Standard</h4>
                            <p>Although there are many ways of defining different aspects of what a home is and how this can be measured, until now there has never been a definition of what the public expects an acceptable home should provide.  The Living Home Standard fills this void by bringing to life what the public believe we should all be able expect our home to provide, in order to secure our wellbeing and provide a foundation from which we can build and live our lives.</p>
                            <p>The Living Home Standard is the result of 9 months of research undertaken by Ipsos MORI on behalf of Shelter and British Gas which aimed to understand what the public believe a home needs to provide in order to achieve an acceptable standard of living.</p>
                            <p>The research began with a detailed literature review and consultation with a number of experts with experience relating to different aspects of housing, including housing demand, architecture, public health and housing policy.  This process uncovered four main themes which were used to structure the subsequent research:</p>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Affordability</li>
                                    <li>Decent conditions</li>
                                    <li>Space</li>
                                    <li>Stability and security of tenure</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>These themes were the starting point for detailed discussions with a cross-section of the public, over 16 discussion groups which took place across England, Scotland and Wales.  In parallel, an online discussion community was established which conducted similar discussions around these themes.  The objective of all the discussions was to establish what the participants believed was needed from a home to support an acceptable standard of physical, mental and social wellbeing and provide a foundation on which they could progress their lives.  The objective of these discussions was to draw people towards a common view on what was important.  It wasn't always possible to achieve a complete consensus amongst participants, but the aim was to converge upon an agreed definition which was acceptable to the vast majority.</p>
                            <p>From these discussions, an initial set of 38 statements was developed that captured the majority of the most important attributes which arose from the discussion groups and online community.  These were put into a quantitative survey of nearly 2,000 British adults to establish which of these attributes were considered the most important.  This used a technique called MaxDiff analysis – this enabled a robust ranking of the relative importance of all 38 attributes to be produced, despite the fact that individual participants were only asked to choose between a limited set of options.  This process helped to tease out differences between a set of attributes which the public already believed were important – this helped to establish which were absolutely vital components of the Standard and which were perhaps only desirable.</p>
                            <p>Following this phase of the work an initial draft of the Living Home Standard was produced: a set of attributes derived from the research which the public believed were necessary for an acceptable home to provide.  These were clustered around five themes – the four established at the outset of the research, and a fifth theme of neighbourhood.  This final theme emerged through the discussions with the public as it became clear that people often satisfied other aspects of their housing needs by compromising on location (or vice versa), and that some aspects of location were extremely important to people.  This fifth theme was therefore introduced to reflect the public's belief that neighbourhood should not be separated from their understanding of home.</p>
                            <p>Within each of the five different dimensions of the draft standard, some statements were classed as essentials – conditions that every home must meet in order to meet the Living Home Standard.  Other statements were classed as tradables.  This describes features of a home which many people believed were important, but they were not universally applicable to or equally desired by everyone.  An example of this is access to outside space – whilst some people believed that having outside space was necessary for wellbeing, others felt a home could be acceptable without it, or that it was only necessary for people in certain circumstances (for example families with children).  It was deemed necessary for a home meet a certain number of the tradable conditions in each dimension of the Standard, but not all, in order for it to achieve the Living Home Standard overall.</p>
                            <p>The draft Standard was presented back to public via a one-day workshop and to the established online community for further discussion, to determine whether they agreed with the definitions and whether they were easily understood.  The draft was further refined following feedback, creating a final list of 39 attributes across the five dimensions.</p>
                            <p>Whether a household meets the Living Home Standard or not can be measured by determining whether the 39 attributes included in the Standard are stated as true or false.</p>
                            <p>A more detail description of the methodology used to develop the Living Home Standard is included in Ipsos MORI’s full report which is available on request from Shelter – <a href="mailto:public_affairs@shelter.org.uk">public_affairs@shelter.org.uk</a>.</p>
