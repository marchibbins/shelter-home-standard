                        <h3>By Renee Stephenson, 18, London</h3>

                        <p>For sixteen frightening months, my family were homeless. My single mother taught us kids that our ‘home’ was in our love for each other, not the sordid temporary accommodation we had found ourselves in. </p>
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Safe’:</strong> Many people in the Great Home Debate have described home as ‘safe’. That ended for me in 2012 when my parents’ divorce resulted in mum being issued with an eviction notice. My siblings were 3, 6 and 8. At 13, I was the only one who understood. Mum and I went into shock. We couldn’t pack: putting everything in boxes felt too real, like admitting it wasn’t all just a cruel joke.</p>
                         
                        <p>When the day came, the council could find us nowhere to stay. Mum’s friend put us up for the night. We stayed for a year. She had her own family, so fitting us in left everyone extremely cramped.</p> 
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Relax’:</strong> Another word people have chosen is ‘relax’. We couldn’t do that. The little ones couldn’t be kids anymore. They couldn’t laugh, play or run without someone telling them: “shhh”. Finally, the council finally found us temporary accommodation in a bed and breakfast. It had one bedroom for us all to share and mould on the walls, but we felt so grateful anyway. When I look back now, it breaks my heart.</p> 
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Security’:</strong> Soon, a family moved in to share our kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen grew filthy. There was faeces on the bathroom wall. Their adult sons moved their mattresses into our communal space. For a single mum, three girls and a little boy with special needs it was very intimidating.</p> 
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Security’</strong> is a word that emerges repeatedly in Shelter’s debate. Instead, we felt so threatened that it affected the little ones’ health. In fact, children living in unfit and overcrowded accommodation are significantly more likely to suffer respiratory problems, anxiety and depression.</p> 
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Escape’:</strong> Another popular word in the Debate is ‘escape’. I had none. To study for my GCSEs I went to the library at the crack of dawn and again after school. Unsurprisingly, when Shelter surveyed families in emergency accommodation, two thirds said their children had problems at school.</p> 
                         
                        <p>We were supposed to be in the B&amp;B for six weeks. Four months went by before a friend put us in touch with Shelter, Mum was at breaking point. She couldn’t carry on convincing us that things would get better for much longer. Shelter, however, were campaigning about families who had been in temporary accommodation for too long. Mum recorded an interview for them and within two weeks we were offered a three-bedroom house.</p>
                         
                        <p><strong>‘Stability’:</strong> We decorated immediately. It was a sign that we had finally won the stability we had fought for, and which is another of the key themes to come through. I got my GCSEs in the end - five As, one A* and three Bs. People say it’s a miracle but I tell them: “No, it’s mum.” How she stayed strong, I will never know. But she made sure we had what I think is the most important word to emerge from the Great Home Debate: ‘love’.</p>
